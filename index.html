<p> Hello readers,
I, Ishan Mehra is going to argue in favour of E-books as I believe that it is a revolutionary development in the world.</p>

<h1><strong>Accessibility</strong></h1>

<p>First and foremost, the invention of e-books which can be assessed via smartphones and tablets has made all the books at our fingertips. People can read them anytime and any where, and this accessibility is really important for students, researchers and avid readers of this busy world who do not have enough time to head to libraries in order to read only.</p>

<h2><strong>Eco-friendly</strong></h2>

<p>Furthermore, E-books are environmentally friendly. The production of physical books demands large amount of paper which can rather be saved if we use e-books everywhere from homes to institutions. Concerning this, I searched for the paper consumption each year just for making books in the whole world, and you will not believe that value was around 85 million tonnes of paper.</p>

<h3><strong>Better learning</strong></h3>

<p>Another benefit of using E-books is that it enhances learning. Through e-books, students learn by the mediums of 3D diagram, videos, aminations which not only clear concepts but also makes the learning interesting and effective.</p>

<h4><strong>Space saving</strong></h4>

<p>Also, E-books are space- efficient. A single device can hold thousands of books which is advantageous to people with less space. E-books allow readers to have entire library with them all the times.</p>



In conclusion, e-books represent progress. They make knowledge accessible to all, contribute to environmental conservation, foster educational innovation, and enhance convenience.


<h1>E-BOOK VS PHYSICAL BOOK</h1>
<p><strong>Memeber-1 Kavit patel</strong></p>

hey there, I am Kavit Patel and i am from Gujarat,India.

 <p>I stand here to defend the timeless charm and irreplaceable value of physical books in our rapidly digitizing world. Physical books are not just objects; they are repositories of culture, vessels of knowledge, and symbols of our collective heritage. For a long time, I was the kind of person who only read eBooks. I could always be found with my Kindle Oasis, talking about how e-readers enable people to carry their entire library around in their pockets. Not anymore. Over the last few years, I have become the kind of person who hangs out in used bookstores, arms filled with piles and piles of books. And I am beginning to think all those people who told me physical books are better had it right.</p>

 <p>First and foremost, physical books provide a sensory experience unmatched by their digital counterparts. The feel of paper beneath our fingertips, the subtle scent of ink and pages, and the satisfaction of turning a physical page create a unique and intimate connection between the reader and the text. If we want to highlight something that crosses over onto the next page, forget about it. Physical books do not have that problem. We can pop open your highlighter and highlight what you want. We can write in the margins, on sticky notes, or on entire sheets of paper you fold between the pages if you want. And when you want to review your notes, it is easy to crack open your physical book to get a feel for the annotations you made.</p>

<p>Physical books also hold sentimental value. They can be passed down through generations, becoming cherished heirlooms that carry the memories of readers from the past. The physical presence of books in our homes and public spaces fosters a culture of reading, inspiring future generations to explore the world through literature. New book, old book, all books smell like a book. The glue, the paper, the ink, I'm not sure what gives a book its smell. It has one that says, "I'm a book. Read me."</p>

<p>Furthermore, physical books do not rely on batteries or electronic devices, making them accessible to everyone, regardless of technological constraints. In a world where digital devices can be fragile and prone to technical issues, physical books offer reliability and longevity. They do not require updates or compatibility checks, ensuring that the knowledge they contain remains accessible for decades.</p>

<p>In conclusion, physical books are not mere relics of the past; they are indispensable pillars of our cultural identity and literary heritage. They offer a sensory and emotional experience, carry sentimental value, remain accessible to all, and contribute to local economies.</p>
